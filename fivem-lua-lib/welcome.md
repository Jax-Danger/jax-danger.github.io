# Welcome to Jax Danger

## 👋 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Jax Danger**, a passionate FiveM developer and content creator. You might know me from my YouTube channel **[CodesAndGames](https://youtube.com/@CodesAndGames)** where I share FiveM development tutorials and insights.

## 🛠️ What I Do

I specialize in creating **development tools and libraries** that make FiveM development easier and more efficient. My goal is simple: **I want to make development as easy and efficient as possible for everyone**.

### My Focus Areas:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Libraries** for FiveM
- **FiveM Lua Libraries** (like the one you're reading about!)
- **Development Frameworks** and tools
- **YouTube Tutorials** on FiveM development

## 🎥 YouTube Content

I create **comprehensive tutorials** on FiveM development, covering everything from basic scripting to advanced frameworks. Currently, I'm working on a **JavaScript framework series** for FiveM that will help developers build better, more maintainable code.

## 🚫 Why I Don't Make Custom Scripts

**Short answer:** I don't have the time or energy, and I want to avoid disappointing clients.

**Long answer:** Custom script development requires a significant time investment and deep understanding of specific requirements. I fear that I would either:
- Charge too much for the work involved
- Not meet the high expectations that come with custom development
- Not be able to provide the ongoing support that custom scripts often need

Instead, I focus on creating **reusable tools and libraries** that benefit the entire community.

## 🛍️ Coming Soon: Resource Store

While I don't do custom scripts, I **do** create FiveM resources for my own use. Soon, I'll be launching a **store page** where I'll sell some of these resources to the community.

These will be **polished, well-documented resources** that I've personally used and refined, rather than rushed custom projects.

## 🎯 My Mission

I believe that **good tools make good developers**. By creating libraries, frameworks, and educational content, I hope to:

- **Reduce development time** for FiveM creators
- **Improve code quality** across the community
- **Make FiveM development more accessible** to newcomers
- **Share knowledge** through tutorials and documentation

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This documentation site showcases my **FiveM Lua Library** - a collection of tools that simplify common FiveM development tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these tools should make your life easier.
